# ExeToApkPythonModule 

This Python module converts EXE files into APK files and integrates Unity Ads or other ad networks into the generated APK.

# Requirements 

To run the module, you'll need to install the following tools:

Python 3.x: Python is required for running the module.

Buildozer: A tool for packaging Python code into APK files.

PyInstaller: A tool to extract Python code from EXE files if needed.

APKTool: A tool for decompiling and modifying APK files.

# Installation Steps 

Install Python 3.x (if not already installed).

Download and install Python from python.org.

Install Buildozer:

Buildozer is needed to compile Python code into APK files. It works best on Linux, but there are workarounds for Windows using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

To install Buildozer, run the following in your terminal: ```bash pip install buildozer```

Install PyInstaller:

PyInstaller will help us convert EXE files (if applicable) into Python scripts before packaging them into APKs.

To install PyInstaller, run: ```bash
pip install pyinstaller```

Install APKTool:

APKTool is required to decompile and modify the APK files, including adding Unity Ads.

On Linux, you can install APKTool using: ```bash sudo apt install apktool```

On Windows, download the APKTool installer from APKTool’s official site.

Create requirements.txt:

The requirements.txt file is used to list all dependencies needed for the module. You can generate it by running: ```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt```

# Usage 1. Convert EXE to APK 

The module works by converting an EXE (if it’s based on Python) to APK format. If the EXE is a native Windows application, you’ll need to adapt the source code first to Python. If it's a Python-based EXE, you can use PyInstaller to extract the Python code and then package it using Buildozer.

Here’s how to use the convert_exe_to_apk function from exe_to_apk.py: ```python
from exe_to_apk import convert_exe_to_apk # Convert EXE to APK convert_exe_to_apk("path/to/your/exe", "output_apk.apk")```

convert_exe_to_apk will attempt to convert the EXE into a Python app and package it into an APK using Buildozer.

2. Add Ads to APK 

Once the APK has been generated, you can add Unity Ads (or other ad networks) to the APK. This is done using add_ads_to_apk from ads_integration.py ```python from ads_integration import add_ads_to_apk # Add ads (Unity Ads) to the generated APK add_ads_to_apk("output_apk.apk")```

add_ads_to_apk will decompile the APK using APKTool, integrate the Unity Ads SDK, and then recompile the APK with ads.

Full Example: 

Here’s how you would combine both steps in a script: ```python from exe_to_apk import convert_exe_to_apk from ads_integration import add_ads_to_apk # Step 1: Convert EXE to APK exe_file = "path/to/your/exe" apk_file = "output_apk.apk" convert_exe_to_apk(exe_file, apk_file) # Step 2: Add ads (Unity Ads) to the APK add_ads_to_apk(apk_file) print(f"APK with ads saved: {apk_file}")```

How It Works Step 1: Convert EXE to APK 

The convert_exe_to_apk function works by attempting to repackage your EXE file as a Python script if the EXE is based on Python. If it's a standard Windows application, you might need to refactor the application logic into a Python script first.

EXE to Python: If your EXE was generated from Python, you can use pyinstaller to extract the original Python code.

You can run:
```bash pyinstaller --onefile your_exe.exe```

This generates the Python code in a folder, and you can then adapt it into a Python app for Android.

Buildozer: After preparing the Python app, we use Buildozer to package it into an APK. The APK can be installed on an Android device.

# Step 2: Add Ads to APK 

Once the APK is generated, you can modify it using APKTool.

Decompile APK: Use APKTool to extract the APK’s content: ```bash apktool d output_apk.apk -o output_dir```

Add Ads: Add the necessary ad SDK (Unity Ads or AdMob) to the project’s AndroidManifest.xml and integrate the SDK’s libraries into the APK.

Recompile APK: Recompile the modified APK: ```bash apktool b output_dir -o modified_apk.apk```

Unity Ads Integration 

Unity Ads integration will require setting up Unity Ads in the Android project and adding the necessary SDK files. You can follow Unity's official documentation to integrate ads into the Android project generated by Buildozer.

Project Structure 
```bash ExeToApkPythonModule/ ├── exe_to_apk.py # Main script to convert EXE to APK ├── ads_integration.py # For injecting ads into APK ├── README.md # Instructions └── requirements.txt # Dependencies```

# Conclusion 

The ExeToApkPythonModule provides a basic framework for converting EXE files (Python-based) into APK files and adding ads to them. It leverages Buildozer for APK packaging and APKTool for modifying APKs after they're generated. The module also integrates Unity Ads (or other networks) to the final APK.

This approach assumes that the EXE can either be rewritten in Python or is a Python-based EXE, and the integration of ads assumes familiarity with Unity Ads or other Android ad SDKs. You'll need to refine the integration of ads based on your app’s needs.
